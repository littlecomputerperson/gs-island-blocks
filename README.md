# Island Blocks

A modern tribute to the classic Tetris game built with OpenGL and cross-platform support using SDL2.

## Description

Island Blocks is a fast-paced puzzle game where players arrange falling blocks to clear lines and score points. The game features two distinct gameplay modes:

- **Normal Mode**: Traditional Tetris gameplay with progressive difficulty levels
- **Advanced Mode (Challenge Mode)**: Enhanced difficulty with special blocks that must be cleared

The game includes 10 difficulty levels, each increasing in speed and complexity. Players can compete for high scores, customize game settings, and enjoy smooth OpenGL-powered graphics with scaling support for various screen resolutions.

## Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **C++11**: Primary programming language
- **OpenGL 2.1**: Graphics rendering (fixed-function pipeline)
- **SDL2**: Cross-platform window management, input handling, and event processing
- **SDL2_mixer**: Audio playback for music and sound effects

### Build System
- **CMake 3.10+**: Cross-platform build configuration
- **Platform-specific**: Visual Studio (Windows), Make/Ninja (Linux/macOS)

## Future Platform Support

### Android
**Feasibility**: High

The game's SDL2 foundation makes Android porting straightforward:
- SDL2 has excellent Android support with touch input mapping
- OpenGL ES 2.0 compatibility layer needed (current code uses OpenGL 2.1)
- File I/O needs adaptation for Android's asset system
- Virtual controls or gesture-based input for touch screens

**Required Changes**:
1. Create Android.mk/CMakeLists.txt for Android NDK
2. Implement touch input in `gs_keyboard.cpp` and `gs_mouse.cpp`
3. Convert OpenGL calls to OpenGL ES 2.0
4. Package assets in APK format
5. Add on-screen controls overlay

### iOS
**Feasibility**: High

Similar to Android, SDL2's iOS support is mature:
- SDL2 provides UIKit integration
- Metal backend available for better performance
- Touch input already supported by SDL2
- App Store compliance for audio/video formats

**Required Changes**:
1. Create Xcode project with SDL2 frameworks
2. Convert OpenGL to OpenGL ES or Metal
3. Implement iOS-specific file paths
4. Add touch controls
5. Handle app lifecycle (pause/resume)
6. Update audio format compatibility

### WebAssembly
**Feasibility**: Medium-High

Using Emscripten to compile to WebAssembly:
- SDL2 has Emscripten support
- OpenGL translates to WebGL
- File I/O needs virtual filesystem
- Audio through Web Audio API

**Required Changes**:
1. Set up Emscripten toolchain
2. Modify file loading for Emscripten's virtual FS
3. Adjust main loop for browser event model
4. Preload assets or implement progressive loading
5. Handle browser-specific input events
6. Optimize asset sizes for web delivery

**Build Command Example**:
```bash
emcc -o IslandBlocks.html $(sources) \
  -s USE_SDL=2 -s USE_SDL_MIXER=2 \
  -s WASM=1 --preload-file data
```

## Controls

### Keyboard
- **Arrow Keys**: Move/rotate blocks (Up rotates, Down speeds drop, Left/Right move horizontally)
- **Enter**: Select menu option / Confirm
- **Escape**: Pause game / Return to menu
- **Space**: Quick drop (hold to drop continuously, press again to stop)
- **P**: Pause/Resume game
- **M**: Mute/Unmute music
- **S**: Mute/Unmute sound effects
- **Alt+Enter**: Toggle fullscreen (Windows only)
- **Alt+X**: Quit application (Windows only)

### Mouse
- Navigate menus by hovering and clicking
- Cursor visible in menus, hidden during gameplay

## Configuration

### Display Settings (settings.ini)
- **DisplayWidth/Height**: Screen resolution
- **WindowMode**: Fullscreen (0) or Windowed (1)
- **EnableVSync**: Vertical sync on/off
- **UseParticles**: Particle effects on/off

### Audio Settings
- **MusicVolume**: 0-255
- **EffectsVolume**: 0-255

### Game Settings
- **IncreaseLevel**: Progressive difficulty (YES) or fixed difficulty (NO)
- **PreviewDrop**: Show preview of where block will land

## Development

### Adding New Block Types
Blocks are defined in `gs_blocks.cpp` constructor. To add new block types:
1. Define block pattern in constructor using `GameBlock` class
2. Update `BLOCK_TYPES` constant
3. Add rendering logic in `RenderBlock()` method
4. Update rotation logic in `TurnBlock()` if needed

### Extending Game Modes
Modify `gs_blocks.cpp` to add new game modes:
1. Define mode constant in header
2. Add menu option in `ModeSelect()`
3. Implement mode-specific logic in `PlayGame()`

### Custom Rendering
The OpenGL rendering system is modular:
- Sprites: `gs_ogl_sprite.cpp`
- Fonts: `gs_ogl_font.cpp`
- Particles: `gs_ogl_particle.cpp`

## License

This project uses libraries with the following licenses:
- **SDL2**: zlib License
- **SDL2_mixer**: zlib License
- **OpenGL**: Various (hardware vendor implementations)

Game code and assets: Check individual file headers for copyright information.

## Troubleshooting

### Linux: "Failed to initialize SDL"
Ensure SDL2 development packages are installed and X11/Wayland is running.

### macOS: "Library not loaded"
Run `install_name_tool` to fix library paths or use `@rpath` in CMake.

### Windows: "Cannot find SDL2.dll"
Copy SDL2.dll and SDL2_mixer.dll to the executable directory.

### Performance Issues
- Disable VSync if experiencing lag
- Reduce resolution in settings
- Check GPU drivers are up to date
- Disable particle effects if needed
